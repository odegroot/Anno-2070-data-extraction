academy_research.json Model Reference
=====================================

GUID:
    A globally unique identifier for this research project. No other entity within Anno 2070 will have the same GUID.
Name:
    Internal name of the research project. This name is NOT displayed in-game; a localization text is used instead.
Name.eng:
    English localized name of the research project. 

category:
    Each project belongs to one of the following categories: Energy, Ecologic, Vehicles, Seed, Public, Special, Production, Research
subcategory (optional):
    Technologies are grouped by the building or unit that they affect. Example: Energy -> CoalPowerPlant -> Productivity CoalPowerPlant

ItemQuality:
    The quality of the research project, expressed as a letter. Possible values: A, B, C, D, null. A is the highest, D is the lowest. Null is equivalent to A.
ItemQuality.stars (redundant, derived from ItemQuality):
    The quality of the research project, expressed as the number of gold stars . Possible values: 0, 1, 2, 3.

icon.base:
    Filename of the base icon of the research project.
icon.overlay (optional):
    Filename of the overlay icon of the research project.
    
affects.GUIDs (optional):
    A list of the GUIDs buildings/units/etc. affected by this technology.
    This property is either absent or has at least one GUID. It is never empty.  
affects.engs (optional):
    English localizations of the GUIDs in the previous list.
    The order is the same, that is, the first localization string corresponds to the first GUID, etc.
    
effect.* (optional):
    Bonuses granted by the technology. All effects are optional.

effect.ActiveCost.Value (int):
effect.ActiveCost.Percental (bool):
effect.ActiveCost.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
effect.InactiveCost.Value (int):
effect.InactiveCost.Percental (bool):
effect.InactiveCost.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
    Maintenance cost bonus.

    The exact meaning of active vs. inactive is not known. All known projects have identical values for active and inactive.

effect.ActiveEcoEffect.Value (int):
effect.ActiveEcoEffect.Percental (bool):
effect.ActiveEcoEffect.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
effect.InActiveEcoEffect.Value (int):
effect.InActiveEcoEffect.Percental (bool):
effect.InActiveEcoEffect.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
    Eco effect of the technology produced by this research project.
    
    Value/Percental/text are probably best explained by example:
    ┌───────┬───────────┬──────┬───────────────┬────────────────┐
    │ Value │ Percental │ text │ normal effect │ boosted effect │
    ├───────┼───────────┼──────┼───────────────┼────────────────┤
    │  -50  │   true    │ -50% │     -30       │      -15       │
    │  -50  │   false   │ -50  │     -30       │      -80       │
    │   50  │   true    │ +50% │      30       │       45       │
    │   50  │   false   │ +50  │      30       │       80       │
    └───────┴───────────┴──────┴───────────────┴────────────────┘

effect.ActiveEnergyProduction.Value (int):
effect.ActiveEnergyProduction.Percental (bool):
effect.ActiveEnergyProduction.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
effect.InActiveEnergyProduction.Value (int):
effect.InActiveEnergyProduction.Percental (bool):
effect.InActiveEnergyProduction.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
effect.ActiveEnergyCost.Value (int):
effect.ActiveEnergyCost.Percental (bool):
effect.ActiveEnergyCost.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
effect.InActiveEnergyCost.Value (int):
effect.InActiveEnergyCost.Percental (bool):
effect.InActiveEnergyCost.text (redundant, derived from Value + Percental):
	The same as ActiveEcoEffect/InActiveEcoEffect, but for Energy production/consumption.
